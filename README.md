# Welcome to my Github Profile!

Hello there! My name is Julius W. and I'm an undergrad Informatics Engineering student that is learning new stuff everyday towards the fastly changing technology for the future.

## My Interests: 

- Internet of Things 🌐
- Artifical Intelligence 🤖
- Android Development 📱
- Back-End Development 💻

These fields are constantly evolving, and I'm always eager to stay up-to-date with the latest trends and technologies. I believe that they have the potential to create a more connected and intelligent world.

## My Finished Project:

- [The Electionn](https://github.com/Jtnqr/the-electionn): an online voting system built with CodeIgniter 4. The project includes features such as student views, admin dashboard views, database management system, final votes, and more. It was designed to select OSIS chairperson and has a secure authentication system.

## Currently Learning: 

- Python 🐍
- Java ☕️
- Kotlin 🎯
- Dart (Flutter) 📱
- Shell languages (sh, bash, zsh) 🐚

I'm currently learning various programming languages such as Python, Java, Kotlin, Dart (Flutter), and Shell languages. These languages are versatile and widely used, and I'm excited to expand my skills and knowledge in them.


Check out my GitHub profile to see some of my projects and code contributions. While many of the repositories may not be useful, they are a testament to my journey in learning programming. From humble beginnings to now, each repository represents a stepping stone in my growth as a developer. So don't be too hard on me if you find some messy or outdated code - we all have to start somewhere! 😊
